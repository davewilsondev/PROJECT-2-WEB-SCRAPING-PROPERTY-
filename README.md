# PROJECT-2-WEB-SCRAPING-PROPERTY-
I want to build an application that will tell me interesting stuff about property in my area.

Some of things that would be good. 
- Tell me if a property has gone down in value. What percentage. 
- Tell me if a property is below market value for its size  i.e number of bed rooms 
- Text me when it find this. 


Would be good if I could adjust the area and search radius.
